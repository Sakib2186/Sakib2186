## Hi stranger 👋

I am Sakib, a dedicated software engineer, who is always on the hunt to explore new alternatives.

I guess I do have an OCD to not stop thinking util and unless I come up with a solution for a given problem :dizzy_face:.

My main tech stack is python, but again as a software engineer I can migrate to any other language as need.
(Such a shame if I couldn't. 4 years of degree but a complete waste :alien:)

I do try to solve [LeetCode]([https://www.example.com](https://leetcode.com/u/Sakib_Sami/)) problems everyday.

Few Fun Facts about me:
  - My life is boring :sob:
  - Never ever dated :sob: :sob:
  - I love cats, but my mom won't let me have one.
  - **Hobbies**: I don't know.
