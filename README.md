## Hi stranger 👋

I am Sakib, a dedicated Software Engineer, who is always on the hunt to explore new alternatives.

I guess I do have an OCD to not stop thinking until and unless I come up with a solution for a given problem :dizzy_face:.

My main tech stack is Python, but again as a software engineer I can migrate to any other language as required except front-end frameworks.
(If I couldn’t, four years of engineering would feel like a bug, not a feature :alien:)

Currently, I am serving as a software engineer at TCL Informatix, a sister concern of Tanvir Constructions Ltd, which happens to be 
a startup where we are making the roots strong with our greatest effort :muscle:.

I do try to solve [LeetCode]([https://www.example.com](https://leetcode.com/u/Sakib_Sami/)) problems everyday.
Do check out some of my pinned projects, which are both personal and collaborative.

Few Fun Facts about me:
  - I HATE FRONTEND 😃
  - My life is boring :disappointed:
  - Never ever dated :sob:
  - I love cats :cat:, but my mom won't let me have one.
  - **Hobbies**: Lately I have been more into game-developement in unity. Let's see what happens :D
